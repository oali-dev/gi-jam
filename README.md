Collect all the gold items by flicking a shuriken and having it bounce off the walls.
Every collision with a wall makes you lose 1 energy and collecting a green item restores 1 energy.
If you reach 0 energy before collecting all the gold items it's game over, but you can retry as many times as you like.
